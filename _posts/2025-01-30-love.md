description: me yapping about how much i'm in love ðŸ’—
---

omfg i'm so in love, i cant even begin to describe it. alright lets back up and get some lore now.
 
i started to go to this new school because my brother got kicked outa my old school, and it's been alright. there has been alot of pain from moving schools because the schedules were widely different. this led me to be stuck in choir even though i wish not to be in choir. 

choir is fun though! i do kinda enjoy the class even though i'm not a singer. it has made me expand my personal boundries and the teacher is awesome. 

some joys choir has gave me was a boy named shane. he's insnae but pretty chill. he kidnapped me and dragged me into robotics club. robotics is quite awseome and actually this saturday i have a competition to go to for robotics. 

speaking of meeting new kids, i fell in love. this girl, no names (i don't wanna leak her name!), has my heart. she is so beautiful, and has an awesome personailty. i can't stop thinking about her, and it might just be driving me nuts. i have never dated a girl in my life ðŸ˜­ so this is very new to me. she doesn't know i like her and i'm scared to tell her or something.
