i'm a high school student who like to program and write stuff. i've made many websites and other things.
i don't quite know my sexuality and things yet, [but i did fall in love with this girl!!](https://blogspace.jackpurrin.me/posts/love/)
i play a lot of minecraft and half-life but my free time is usually spent on github, or random websites such as uquiz. 
what do you listen to? i don't quite know. i do listen to some hip hop and rap, but then i listen to stuff like frank sinatra one day. or some indie stuff. i love mac demarco!

i want to work on a useless web clone.
